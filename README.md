# CaptainLock
## Requirements
This is a Spigot plugin that requires PermissionsEx for full functionality.
## What it does
CaptainLock allows you to lock chests. This prevents other players from accessing them, or requiring them to input a password to open it. To lock a double chest, you must lock each individual chest block.

A secondary function allows cuboid zones to be created that can be protected from other players. Blocks can't be broken, placed, etc. unless the player has permission to do so in the zone.
